  <h3>About</h3>

  <p>Army ANT was created by <a href="http://josedevezas.com">Jos√© Devezas</a>, as part of his PhD in "Graph-Based Entity-Oriented Search". The goal was to provide a platform where testing novel search approaches would be quick and easy, by minimizing implementation requirements through code reusing.</p>

  <p>For example, if you just want to test a custom ranking function using Lucene, why go through all the work of pre-processing a collection, iterating over it and indexing the documents all over again, just to test that one ranking function? With Army ANT, you can reuse available readers to iterate over documents in supported collections (or implement your own, but just once, and then the community can also reuse it).</p>

  <p>Another advantage of Army ANT is that it provides out-of-the-box evaluation, letting you test multiple ranking functions per representation model, as well as define parameter configurations to help you determine which values result in the best effectiveness.</p>


  <h3>Getting Started</h3>

  <p>For the time being, you can refer to Chapter 2 of the technical report I wrote for MAP-i's Scientific Activities, for documentation about Army ANT: <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10216/110181" rel="nofollow">Army ANT: A Workbench for Innovation in Entity-Oriented Search</a>.</p>

    <span class="label label-warning">TODO: explain how to install and use Army ANT with current implementations.</span>
    <span class="label label-warning">TODO: explain how to implement a basic engine (show class headers with stub functions).</span>
