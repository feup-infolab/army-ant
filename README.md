# Army ANT

For the time being, you can refer to Chapter 2 of the technical report I wrote for MAP-i's Scientific Activities, for documentation about Army ANT: [Army ANT: A Workbench for Innovation in Entity-Oriented Search](http://hdl.handle.net/10216/110181).

As an information retrieval researcher, defining an engine in Army ANT (i.e., implementing an `index()` and `search()` methods) will give you direct access to a web interface with the following features. You can check [Army ANT's sequence diagram](https://github.com/feup-infolab/army-ant/blob/master/resources/army_ant-sequence_diagram.pdf) to better understand what a typical workflow looks like.

You can also check the command line [examples](https://github.com/feup-infolab/army-ant/blob/master/EXAMPLES.md) for `index` and `extras`, as well as information about the demo instance and how to install it using [Docker](https://github.com/feup-infolab/army-ant/blob/master/DOCKER.md). Finally, you can view the Web UI in action through available [screenshots](https://github.com/feup-infolab/army-ant/blob/master/SCREENSHOTS.md).
